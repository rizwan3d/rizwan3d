                                    Recently, I felt overly annoyed by my messy download folder on my personal computer.
                                    There were too many
                                    files, and it was in a total mess. I thought to write a simple bot to address this
                                    problem. The Solution
                                    Solution is a Bot that loops the download, desktop or any other folder and
                                    determines the file type for
                                    each and every file. Subsequently, it creates a folder for that file type. All files
                                    with the same file
                                    type will be transferred to this folder and or Organise by Date. We use .Net Core to
