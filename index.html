                                    Recently, I felt overly annoyed by my messy download folder on my personal computer. There were too many files, and it was a total mess. I thought to write a simple bot to address this problem. The Solution Solution is a Bot that loops the download, desktop, or any other folder and determines the file type for every file. Subsequently, it creates a folder for that file type. All files with the same file type will be transferred to this folder and or organized by Date. We use .Net Core to make it cross-platform. But the same code works well for .Net Framework, .Net Standard, and Xamarin so it works on every popular device today</li>
